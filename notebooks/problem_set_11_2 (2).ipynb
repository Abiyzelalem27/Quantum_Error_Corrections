    "3) Syndrome measurement: In order to perform the syndrome measurement you have to build the projectors $(P_0,P_1,P_2,P_3)$ onto the subspaces corresponding to different error syndromes, i.e., possible outcomes of the syndrome measurement. With these you can simulate the syndrome measurement using the function `doMeasurement()` provided below. Make sure you understand what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Recovery: Apply the recovery operation corresponding to the detected syndrome, i.e., apply the channel $\\mathcal{E}(\\rho)=M_i \\rho M_i^\\dagger$ with $M_i = 1,X_1,X_2,X_3$, respectively, for the bit flip channel.\n",

    "The error correction protocol is not always successful, namely in the case where two or three errors occur. How does this manifest in the simulated protocol? Try different input states and different noise strengths.\n"
